# Contribution Guidelines

* NO CRYPTO(currency) GO AWAY

* Images must have descriptive file names in the following format:

    File_Names_Are_Cool.png

* Add your images to the folder that best describes the subject matter of the book that the girl is holding. If no existing folder applies create a new one.

* All characters added pretty much always must be female presenting, meaning that they are either canonically female or at least look and act like they're girls. 
    
* __No nudity (I really don't want to get banned)__
